# BACKGROUND
This is a playground for various LLM and AI experiments. Initially it will be a resume question-answering chatbot, maybe adding the ability to convincingly interview for a job later.
Eventually I'd like to vectorize every e-mail, chat, essay, social media post, etc. I've archived and use RAG or perhaps model fine-tuning to create a more complete "Virtual Ryan".

The current implementation is using [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) to provide speed and a large context window for all the background information in my resume and documentation.
