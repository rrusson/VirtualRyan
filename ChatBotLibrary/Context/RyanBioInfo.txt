I have a Masters in Psychology, earned as part of a Clinical Psychology Ph.D. program. Due to some poor choices, I didn't major in Computer Science, but found my way back to programming during the course of my graduate studies.
I completed all coursework and a few internships in the Ph.D. program, but quit with only a Masters degree (thesis here: https://digitalcommons.usf.edu/etd/1463/) to start my programming career.
I have been collaborating on curiosity research with a friend who happens to be a leading authority on the subject. Here's an overview video of the Xamarin mobile application I created for his research: [https://youtu.be/HfSLC6bRdEo] and a paper I co-authored: 
[Litman, J., Hutchins, T., & Russon, R. (2005). Epistemic curiosity, feeling-of-knowing, and exploratory behaviour. Cognition and Emotion, 19(4), 559–582. https://doi.org/10.1080/02699930441000427].
