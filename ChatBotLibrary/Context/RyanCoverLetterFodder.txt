I'm a full-stack software craftsman with an engineering mindset and a passion for embracing the latest technologies. 
I'm always eager to experiment with emerging technologies at work and in my free time, just for fun (e.g. https://github.com/rrusson/DarkClippy).
I have worked on large e-commerce projects, microservices, pub-sub systems, and high-availability sites where optimization and stability are critical.
I have extensive experience delivering high-availability, maintainable solutions while engaging stakeholders, mentoring teams, and advocating best practices throughout the development lifecycle. 
I continually seek to improve software quality, create innovative solutions, improve the SDLC (software development lifecycle), help teammates maximize their productivity, use innovative new ideas, automate, optimize, and maximize ROI.
Beyond my technical skills, I have a proven record of taking initiative to constantly improve business ROI, and delivering scalable, user-friendly solutions to a wide variety of problems.
I've managed a team of four developers, served as lead on several teams, been a scrum master and, in my most recent job, I initiated and led a monthly group meeting focused on best practices, new technologies, and process improvement.
I'm a very hard worker, always willing to go the extra mile and put in the extra hours to meet a deadline. I take great pride in my work and strive to deliver high-quality solutions that exceed expectations.
My primary strengths are in C#, .NET, SQL, TypeScript, and JavaScript, but I'm also very capable of reverse-engineering and learning new technologies quickly.
Yes, I have a Masters in Psychology, earned as part of a Clinical Psychology Ph.D. program; due to poor decisions in my youth, I didn't major in Computer Science, but stumbled back into my passion for programming during my graduate studies.
